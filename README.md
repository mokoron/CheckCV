# CheckCV
 
Recruiters recommend modifying your CV for each vacancy. How do you know if the modification fits the job?

Here is a fan service: https://checkcv.streamlit.app/.

You feed a CV in PDF or DOCX format, copy-paste the vacancy of interest, and see the percentage of how the CV fits the vacancy. The higher the number, the more your CV matches the vacancy.

Under the hood, of course, is a bit of machine learning and math.
